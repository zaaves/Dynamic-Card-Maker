## Custom Card Adder

In my recent React project,
I developed a web application that captures user inputs for a name, email, and image URL,
and dynamically creates a card displaying this information upon submission.
This project showcases my skills in handling forms, 
managing state with React hooks,
and dynamically rendering components based on user inputs.
